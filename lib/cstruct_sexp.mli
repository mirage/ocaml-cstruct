(** Sexpression serialisers for {!Cstruct.t} values *)

type buffer = Cstruct.buffer
(** [buffer] is an alias for the corresponding {!type:Cstruct.buffer} type *)

val sexp_of_buffer : Cstruct.buffer -> Sexplib0.Sexp.t
(** [sexp_of_buffer b] returns the s-expression representation of the raw memory buffer [b] *)

val buffer_of_sexp : Sexplib0.Sexp.t -> Cstruct.buffer
(** [buffer_of_sexp s] returns a fresh memory buffer from the s-expression [s].
    [s] should have been constructed using {!sexp_of_buffer}. *)

(** [t] is an alias for the corresponding {!Cstruct.t} type *)

val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexplib0.Sexp.t
(** [sexp_of_t t] returns the s-expression representation of the Cstruct [t] *)

val t_of_sexp : Sexplib0.Sexp.t -> t
(** [t_of_sexp s] returns a fresh {!Cstruct.t} that represents the
     s-expression previously serialised by {!sexp_of_t}. *)
