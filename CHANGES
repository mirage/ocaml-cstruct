===== 0.6.0 (20-Dec-2012) =====

* Add fast bigarray<->string functions to replace byte-by-byte copies.

* Add an Lwt sub-package to expose a write call.

* Depend on ocplib-endian for fast low-level parsing of integers.

* Make Cstruct.t a record type that doesn't use Bigarray slicing
  to provide views onto buffers. This lets views be allocated directly
  on the minor heap rather than forcing a major heap allocation. It
  does alter the external API, so previous users of cstruct wont work.

===== 0.5.3 (16-Dec-2012) =====

* No functional changes, just OASIS packaging fix to right version.

===== 0.5.2 (11-Dec-2012) =====

* Remove the separate `xen` and `unix` subdirectories, as the
  portable `Bigarray` is now provided by the `xenbigarray` package.

===== 0.5.1 (28-Sep-2012) =====

* Add string_to_<cenum> function to match the <cenum>_to_string,
  primarily to help with command-line parsing of enum arguments.
 
===== 0.5.0 (20-Sep-2012) =====

* Add a signature generator for cstruct and cenum to permit
  their use in .mli files.

* Use the more reliable revised syntax camlp4 quotation
  expander, to avoid broken AST output from antiquotations.

* Switch the xen/ version over to using OASIS also.

===== 0.4.0 (02-Sep-2012) =====

* Fix META file for use with Xen

===== 0.3 (25-Aug-2012) =====

* Initial public release
