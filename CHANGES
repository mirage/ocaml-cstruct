0.6.1 (20-Dec-2012):
* Add `sendto`, `read` and `recvfrom` functions to the Lwt subpackage.

0.6.0 (20-Dec-2012):
* Add fast bigarray<->string functions to replace byte-by-byte copies.
* Add an Lwt sub-package to expose a write call.
* Depend on ocplib-endian for fast low-level parsing of integers.
* Make `Cstruct.t` a record type that doesn't use Bigarray slicing
  to provide views onto buffers. This lets views be allocated directly
  on the minor heap rather than forcing a major heap allocation. It
  does alter the external API, so previous users of cstruct wont work.

0.5.3 (16-Dec-2012):
* No functional changes, just OASIS packaging fix to right version.

0.5.2 (11-Dec-2012):
* Remove the separate `xen` and `unix` subdirectories, as the
  portable `Bigarray` is now provided by the `xenbigarray` package.

0.5.1 (28-Sep-2012):
* Add `string_to_<cenum>` function to match the `<cenum>_to_string`,
  primarily to help with command-line parsing of enum arguments.

0.5.0 (20-Sep-2012):
* Add a signature generator for cstruct and cenum to permit their use in `.mli` files.
* Use the more reliable revised syntax camlp4 quotation expander, to avoid 
  broken AST output from antiquotations.
* Switch the `xen/` version over to using OASIS also.

0.4.0 (02-Sep-2012):
* Fix META file for use with Xen

0.3 (25-Aug-2012):
* Initial public release
